    "Welcome to the world of REST APIs! If you're curious about how different applications communicate with each other over the web, you're in the right place. In this introduction, we'll explore the basics of REST (Representational State Transfer) APIs and how you can interact with them using Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is a REST API?\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"data/images/api.png\" width=\"75%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "A REST API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and conventions for building and interacting with web services. It allows different software applications to communicate with each other over the internet by using standard HTTP methods, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Concepts:\n",
    "1. Resources:\n",
    "In a REST API, everything is considered a resource. These resources can be data objects, services, or entities, and each is uniquely identified by a URL, often referred to as an endpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. HTTP Methods:\n",
    "RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods to perform different operations on resources:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **GET**: Retrieve data from a specified resource.\n",
    "- **POST**: Create a new resource.\n",
    "- **PUT**: Update an existing resource.\n",
    "- **DELETE**: Remove a resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Request and Response:\n",
    "When you make a request to a REST API endpoint, you send an HTTP request, and the server responds with an HTTP response. The response typically includes the requested data or information about the success or failure of the request.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interacting with REST APIs in Python:\n",
    "1. Requests Library:\n",
    "Python provides the requests library, which simplifies the process of sending HTTP requests. You can install it using:"

    "Altair is built on  [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/), which is a Grammar of Interactive Graphics. Vega-Altair provides a user-friendly way to use this through Python, storing the graphical specifications in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format. You can directly view these specifications in any web browser, and coding is easy in JupyterLab, Jupyter Notebook, Microsoft VS-Code, and Google Colab."
